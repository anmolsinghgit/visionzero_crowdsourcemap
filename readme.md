## Description
Boston Bike Safety 
These are locations where cyclists, pedestrians, motorists and  were “nearly missed” by motor vehicles. 

Description
Users with CRUD interactions are able to input locations of dangerous intersections in Boston using a google maps interface and a user form. The latitude and longitude values of the locations will be used (in the future) to create new markers on the map with tooltips showing details about the “nearly missed” location given by the user. Users can read and update these points on the map.

## Details for teaching team
Project complete for the requirements of the course, but I will continue to work on it in the upcoming weeks. Follows CRUD but I will work to connect to Microsoft SQL server and map points from data api. <http://loosine.com/data>
